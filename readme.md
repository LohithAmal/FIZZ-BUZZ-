# FIZZ BUZZ

* fizz buzz is an algorithum that have a function generates numbers from 1 to num.

* algorithum works as if the number is divisible by 3 it shows **fizz** and if the number is divisible by 5 it shows **buzz** also, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then it shows **fizzbuzz**.

* this algorithum works with concept of **modules operator** 

* **modules operators** which gives the remainder of a number after that number has been divided by another number.
* example: 
  - 7 % 3 (this means 7 modulus 3. ie, 7 divided by 3 and return back the remainder) = **1**  
  - 100 % 30 = 10 (is the remainder).
* fizz buzz algorithum is build with this concept.
